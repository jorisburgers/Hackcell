	\section{Problem Description}
	The problem that Hackcell will solve is the calculation of spreadsheets. This means that, given a spreadsheet with combined values and expressions, Hackcell will provide a spreadsheet where all expressions are replaced with their appropriate value. This spreadsheet can be of arbitrary size and dimensions. There is a number of problems that Hackcell will solve.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The ability to allow arbitrary data types in the same spreadsheet. Users can use their own types and are not limited to a number of predefined types. 
	\item Remove the limitation of the number of dimensions. Most spreadsheet programs give the user a limited amount of dimensions to work with. We want to remove this restriction and let a user define a spreadsheet of arbitrary size and dimensions.
	\item Detection of cyclic references. In a spreadsheet, cells can reference other cells and this can cause a cycle. This cycle will be detected, preventing an endless loop.
	\item The possibility to allow users to update specific cells without the need to recompute the entire spreadsheet. The only cells that will be updated are those cells that depend on the changed cell.
	\item The only values that are computed are the values that need to be computed. This can be done using the laziness that is already present in Haskell. 
\end{itemize}
